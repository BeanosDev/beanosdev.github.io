			<h2>Emails - Proton Mail</h2>
			<p>Proton Mail is a secure email service designed with privacy and user control in mind. It employs end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the sender and recipient can read the contents of an email. This encryption is applied automatically, without requiring additional software or technical expertise from the user.</p>
			<p>One of the standout features of Proton Mail is its support for custom domains. Users can easily set up email addresses using their own domain names, such as yourname@yourdomain.com, to send and receive messages. This feature is accessible through Proton Mail's paid plans.</p>
			<p>Proton Mail also offers advanced email filtering capabilities through the use of Sieve scripts. These scripts allow users to create complex rules for managing incoming emails, such as sorting messages into specific folders or applying labels based on various criteria. This level of customization helps in maintaining an organized and efficient inbox.</p>
			<p>In addition to email services, Proton Mail's paid plans include access to other privacy-focused tools like Proton VPN, Proton Drive, and Proton Calendar. These integrated services provide a comprehensive suite for users seeking enhanced security and privacy across their digital activities.</p>
			<p>Overall, Proton Mail combines robust security features with user-friendly customization options, making it a suitable choice for individuals who prioritize privacy, simplicity, and control over their digital communications.</p>
